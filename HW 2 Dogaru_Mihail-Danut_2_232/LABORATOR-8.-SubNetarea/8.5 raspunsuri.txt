Part 1:
	Step1:	
		How many host addresses are available in a /25 network? -> 126
		What is the total number of host addresses needed in the topology diagram? -> 80
		How many subnets are needed in the network topology? -> 6
		
	Step2:
		What is the subnet description (e.g. BR1 LAN or BR1-BR2 link)? -> BR1-LAN
		What subnet mask can support that many host addresses? -> /26
		How many total host addresses can that subnet mask support? -> 62
		Can you subnet the 192.168.33.128/25 network address to support this subnet? ->da
		What are the network addresses that would result from this subnetting? -> 192.168.33.128/26 si 192.168.33.192/26
		
	Step3:
		What is the subnet description? -> BR2 LAN
		How many IP addresses are required for the second largest subnet? -> 25
		What subnet mask can support that many host addresses? ->/27
		How many total host addresses can that subnet mask support? ->30
		Can you subnet the remaining subnet again and still support this subnet? -> da
		What are the network addresses that would result from this subnetting? 192.168.33.192/27 si 192.168.33.224/27
		
	Step4:
		What is the subnet description? -> BR2 IoT LAN
		How many IP addresses are required for the next largest subnet? -> 5
		What subnet mask can support that many host addresses? -> /29
		How many total host addresses can that subnet mask support? -> 6
		Can you subnet the remaining subnet again and still support this subnet? ->da
		What are the network addresses that would result from this subnetting? -> 192.168.33.224/29 si 192.168.33.232/29, 192.168.33.240/29, 192.168.33.248/29
		
	Step5:
		What is the subnet description? -> BR1-BR2 Link
		How many IP addresses are required for the next largest subnet? -> 2
		What subnet mask can support that many host addresses? -> /30
		How many total host addresses can that subnet mask support? -> 2
		Can you subnet the remaining subnet again and still support this subnet? -> da
		What are the network addresses that would result from this subnetting? -> 192.168.33.248/30 si 192.168.33.252/30
